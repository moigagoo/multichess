* Introduction

Multichess is heavily inspired by [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1349230/5D_Chess_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel/][that 5D chess game]]. However, the
rules are not exactly the same.

* Rules

Read the code and figure it out yourself. (just kidding, I'll write
these soon)

* Building

Make sure you have a recent version of ~nim >= 1.3.5~ along with
~nimble~.

Then,

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ nimble build
#+END_SRC


This should make a ~web/web.js~ file. Now, open ~web/index.html~.
