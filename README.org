* Introduction

Multichess is heavily inspired by [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1349230/5D_Chess_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel/][that 5D chess game]]. However, the
rules are not exactly the same.

* Rules

Read the code and figure it out yourself. (just kidding, I'll write
these soon)

* Building

Have these installed (look into ~choosenim~ if you don't use it, it
makes installing the below trivial):
  - ~nim~ (as of 2020-09-06 the ~devel~ branch is needed to compile
    ~multichess~. Unfortunately, stable version ~1.2.6~ doesn't work.)
  - ~nimble~

Then, the following command will install all of the nim dependencies
and build this project.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ nimble build
#+END_SRC


This should make a ~web/web.js~ file. Now, open ~web/index.html~.
